# AI Predictve Defense

⚠️ AI Predictive Defense is an agent powered by Artificial Intelligence


# How does it work

 - 🚨 This agent powered and trained by the top notch Nvidia technology is able to protect your endpoints, by detecting and identifying attacks before an attacker performs the attack.
 - ❓ It's possible thanks to the largest dataset built in collaboration with the most famous Antivirus vendors, that trained the AI to understand attackers intentions and block them before they take an action.
